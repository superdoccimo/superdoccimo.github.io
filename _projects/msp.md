Minokamo Secure Protocol (MSP) is a minimal TCP-based protocol crafted for educational purposes. It demonstrates how to design a custom network protocol with CRC validation, structured binary packets, and optional AES encryption.

**Key Features:**

- **CRC Validation:** Checks packet integrity across the network.
- **Structured Binary Packets:** Uses a concise binary format for requests and responses.
- **AES Encryption:** Supports encrypted communication when enabled.
- **Python Reference Implementation:** Client and server examples for quick testing.

**Usage Notes:**

Clone the repository and explore the provided Python examples to see MSP in action. The documentation details the packet layout, CRC calculation, and how to enable encryption for secure transfers.
