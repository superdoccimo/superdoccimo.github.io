This project provides an Excel VBA macro solution designed to automatically fetch comprehensive stock data—including current prices, stock names, and trading volumes—for over 4000 companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). Leveraging the code list provided by JPX, the macro efficiently processes large datasets by utilizing asynchronous processing and optimized looping techniques.

**Key Features:**

- **Automated Data Retrieval:** Fetches real-time stock data from the TSE using JPX's code list.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Optimizes execution to bypass Excel’s calculation constraints.
- **Efficient Handling of Large Datasets:** Seamlessly processes information for over 4000 stocks.
- **Easy Setup:** Simply download the provided Excel file (4000over.zip), unzip, open the file, and enable macros to start retrieving stock information.

**Prerequisites:**

- Microsoft Excel installed.
- Access to Rakuten Securities' Market Speed 2.

For detailed installation instructions, usage guidelines, and additional resources (blog posts and video tutorials), please refer to the repository documentation.
